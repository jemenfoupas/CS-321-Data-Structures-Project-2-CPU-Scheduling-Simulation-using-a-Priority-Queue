# Project #: CPU Scheduling Simulation using a Priority Queue

* Author: Rich Boundji
* Class: CS321 Section #3
* Semester: FALL 2021

## Overview
	
This program simulates a scheduling algorithm for assigning process to the CPU. it generates process and then order them in a heap 
and feeds the CPU by looking at the priority and arrival time of the process.

## Reflection

This project was difficult for me, I struggled to understand what each of the classes were supposed to do
so, it took me more time to get stated, it was also hard for me to understand and apply the pseudocode.
I which that the project guide was clearer on those things.

this project made me realize that I need to get better at reading pseudocode but also 
that i need to get better overall, for this project I needed the tutors to explain each part to me and 
I want to improve so that I would not need the help of others to understand.

## Compiling and Using

 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
 $ javac *.java
 
 Run the compiled class file with the command:
 $ java CPUScheduling <maxProcessTime> <maxPriorityLevel> <timeToIncrementPriority> <simulationTime> <processArrivalRate> [<seed>]
 

## Results 

when running the run-test.sh the values are matching to what is expected.

## Sources used

the only thing that I used for this project were my other projects so that I would understand better and
I also got help from the tutors.
